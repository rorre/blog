I'm a Beatmap Nominator in a game called [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) and a tech enthusiast. I am still a highschool student living in Depok, Indonesia. I mostly do small projects during my spare time, notably using [Python](https://python.org/) language. Some of my projects are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/rorre) or [Gitea](https://git.rorre.xyz/).
